# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

import math
a,b = int(input()),int(input())
c,d = int(input()),int(input())
e,f = int(input()),int(input())
sqr = a*a
rec = b*c
cir = math.pi*d*d
tri= int((1/2*(e*f)))
print(f"Area of Square={sqr}")
print(f"Area of Rectangle={rec}")
print("Area of Circle={:.2f}".format(cir))
print(f"Area of Triangle={tri}")
