# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

num1 = int(input().strip())
num2 = int(input().strip())
op = input().strip()

if op == '+':
    print(f"Addition of two number is {float(num1 + num2)}")
elif op == '-':
    print(f"Subtraction of two number is {float(num1 - num2)}")
elif op == '*':
    print(f"Multiplication of two number is {float(num1 * num2)}")
elif op == '/':
    if num2 != 0:
        print(f"Division of two number is {float(num1 / num2)}")
    else:
        print("Division by zero is not allowed")
elif op == '%':
    if num2 != 0:
        print(f"Modulo of two number is {float(num1 % num2)}")
    else:
        print("Division by zero is not allowed")
else:
    print("Invalid Input")
